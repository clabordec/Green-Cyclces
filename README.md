## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project supports **GreenCYCLES**, a sustainability-focused company, by building and analyzing their operational database.
As a **Data Analyst**, the goal is to:
- Structure and query customer, sales, and inventory data.
- Provide **impactful insights** to optimize business decisions.
- Develop **dashboards and reports** for stakeholders.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- ðŸ“Š **Customer Analytics** â€“ identify trends, retention, and high-value customers.
- ðŸ“¦ **Inventory Optimization** â€“ measure turnover, stock efficiency, and waste reduction.
- ðŸ’° **Sales Insights** â€“ highlight seasonal patterns and growth opportunities.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Performance Metrics** â€“ track KPIs for long-term sustainability.

## ðŸ“‚ Repo Organization
- `data/` â†’ raw and cleaned datasets.
- `notebooks/` â†’ step-by-step SQL & Python analyses.
- `queries/` â†’ modular SQL scripts for reproducibility.
- `reports/` â†’ executive summaries & visual dashboards.
- `src/` â†’ ETL, data cleaning, and visualization tools.

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** â€“ querying and transformations.
- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** â€“ analysis and visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** â€“ exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Power BI / Tableau (optional)** â€“ business dashboards.

## ðŸ“Š Example Insights
- **Customer Analysis**: 65% of repeat customers drive 80% of revenue.
- **Inventory**: Reducing overstock by 12% could save ~$50K annually.
- **Sales Trends**: Peak demand occurs in Q2, suggesting targeted campaigns.

ðŸ‘‰ This repo is structured for **professional analytics delivery** â€“ making it easy for both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders to understand findings.
